# THESIS AISL-1-2425-2
AQUA-Î¼: A Portable Microplastic Detection System using Object Detection Algorithm 

### A short few things to say
GitHub can be overwhelming at first, especially if you have never used this platform before ***like actually***, but it is possibly the best way for us to collaborate in terms of coding, software, etc. With that, I recommend taking the time reading, learning, and trying the following guides to get started with GitHub:

1. https://dev.to/parnab03/the-ultimate-git-github-guide-from-beginner-to-advanced-2aoh
2. https://skills.github.com/
3. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey

### Goals of this GitHub Repo
1. Let everyone be on the same page in terms of hardware and software components
2. Collaborate on the software (object detection algorithm)
3. Documentation
4. Learn, learn, learn
5. ***Give us confidence that we absolutely know what we are doing***

## THESIS WORKFLOW
* Gathering of samples
* Creating custom dataset
* Training the object detection algorithm (YOLOv8) using Google Colab
* Deploying on the Raspberry Pi 5 with AI Kit add-on
* Evaluating the performance of the system

### Gathering of samples

We gathered microplastics from the shore of Manila Bay and Dolomite Beach. Others were artificially created by cutting plastic wrappers into tiny pieces. 

**Not much to say about it, but I will come back on this section soon.**

### Creating custom dataset

After gathering the samples, we took hundreds of pictures of the samples using the Raspberry Pi 5 and Arducam IMX519. Then, we used Roboflow to create the custom dataset. I will thoroughly explain each step moving forward.

Taking pictures of the samples

Code Block Example:

```
git status
```
